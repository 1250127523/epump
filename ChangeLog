EPump is renamed from the eprobe system, an event-driven library developed
by the author in 2003 based on a shared multi-threaded, non-blocking
communication model. The eprobe system has been applied to the development
of many communication software as basic framework in commercial and has been
tested in practice.

The original version of the Eprobe system version 0.1.1 was launched in
March 2003. And the initial name of the released system was called "Probe".
Over the next few years, iterative development of the probe system had been
ongoing, releasing versions from 0.1.x to 0.9.10. When version 1.0 was 
launched in 2007, with the support of epoll, probe was renamed Eprobe, 
meaning "extended probe".

EPump is evolved from eprobe system, symbolizing many pumps for various
read/write events from file-descriptors or timeout events from the timers.

The newest verion 2.1.8 of EPump library is launched as a high-performance
event-driven multi-threaded framework.
